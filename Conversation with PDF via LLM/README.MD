# RAG Conversation from PDF via LLM

This project aims to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) conversation system using a PDF as the source document. The system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) from Groq, an open-source LLM, to facilitate interactive conversations. Users can upload a PDF and initiate a conversation based on the content of the document. The chat and session history are stored for future reference, allowing users to continue their conversations seamlessly.

## Features
- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload a PDF document to serve as the knowledge base for the conversation.
- **Interactive Chat**: Engage in a conversation with the LLM, which retrieves and generates responses based on the content of the uploaded PDF.
- **Session History**: All chat sessions are stored, enabling users to review and continue past conversations.

## Technologies Used
- **Groq Open Source LLM**: Utilized for natural language understanding and response generation.
- **Session Management**: Ensures that chat history is maintained and accessible.

## Getting Started
1. Upload your PDF document.
2. Start a conversation with the LLM.
3. Review and continue your chat sessions as needed.

This project provides an innovative way to interact with documents, making information retrieval and conversation more intuitive and efficient.
